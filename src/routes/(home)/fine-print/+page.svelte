			<ul class="wp-block-list">
				<li>
					You (or your team) retain the rights to anything you create during the Terrible Ideas
					Hackathon*.
				</li>

				<li>
					To enable us to promote and share the event and projects, you give Questionable Research
					Labs (the creators of Terrible Ideas) the right to display and distribute information
					about the project. This includes any text, photos, or videos submitted to us at the end of
					the event in the project submission stage, or photos and videos recorded during or after
					the weekend by our team.
				</li>

				<li>
					If you wish to keep your project private, you can opt out of this by notifying your local
					event organiser or by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@terriblehack.nz"
						>contact@terriblehack.nz</a
					>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				tl;dr: you own your project, but we get to show people what you’ve made for marketing the
				event in the future. Unless you don’t want us to – that’s okay too.

			<h2>MEDIA PERMISSION</h2>

			<p>
				Audiovisual recordings (e.g, photos) of attendees and projects might be used for promotional
				and marketing purposes for us and our sponsors. If you wish to not be included in
				audiovisual recordings, we’re more than happy to oblige. Please notify <a
					href="mailto:contact@terriblehack.nz">contact@terriblehack.nz</a
				> before the event if you have any questions or would like to request this.

				<li>
					In the unlikely case of event cancellation, the liability of the organisers will be
					limited to the return of paid registration fees. In addition, the organisers may alter the
					location of the event at any time with notice to you. While we apologise in advance should
					an unlikely scenario cause inconvenience, the organisers will not be liable for any loss,
					damages or expenses that may arise.
				</li>

				<li>
					In the unlikely case of property you bring being lost, stolen, or damaged, neither
					Terrible Hack nor the venue will be held responsible for the replacement or repair of
					these items. That is to say that you alone are responsible for anything you bring to the
					event.
				</li>

				<li>
					In the case that you, or a guest you invited, cause damage to Terrible Hack’s, the
					University of Auckland’s, or another participant’s property, you will be held liable for
					any costs of repair or replacement.
				</li>
